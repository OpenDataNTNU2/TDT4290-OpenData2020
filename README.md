# Welcome to TDT4290-OpenData2020
This repository is the product of a student project at NTNU, in the class "TDT4290 - Customer driven project", during the fall semester of 2020.  
The goal of this project was to explore new ways for entrepreneurs and municipality workers to cooperate on publishing and using municipal open data.  

The code is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.  
The backend runs an ASP.NET server, built on .NET, written in C#.  
The frontend runs a next.js application, built on react.js, written in javascript and typescript.  
The backend has NUnit testing integrated, and the frontend has Jest tests via babel.  
The GitHub repository contains Actions that will automatically build and run tests on the frontend and backend whenever pull requests and pushes are made to the `release` or `dev` branches.

## Where to find information
There are three main README files in this repository.
1. In the folder `backend` is information on setting up and running the backend of the program for development.  
2. In the folder `frontend` is information on setting up and running the frontend of the program for development.  
3. In the folder `config` is information on how to set up the backend and frontend for both development, and for release, as well as information on setting up and running a server.  

There is also an `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` in this folder, which holds detailed instructions on how to set up the system from scratch.  
Besides this, there is a `USER_GUIDE.md` which explains the interface and functionality from the perspective of a user.  

Additionally, the GitHub page has a Wiki that contains some information on our branch management methods.
