Place the .env.local file directly in the frontend folder to override the backend host address.  
Single #-signs are used to comment out a line.

## Backend
Place the appsettings.development.json file directly in the backend folder to be able to connect to the database.  
You also have to put in a string value of the `PostgresSQL` object in order to connect to the PostgreSQL database. This is found on slack->backend or by asking one in the team if you are not in the slack channel.
